Meteor X3DOM integration demo
=================

[See the demo at 3d.meteor.com!](http://3d.meteor.com/)

### What is this?
[X3DOM](http://www.x3dom.org/) is a way to represent 3D scenes in the DOM and
[Meteor](http://meteor.com) makes it easy to update the DOM in reaction to changes in data.

Looks like they could be meant for each other!
